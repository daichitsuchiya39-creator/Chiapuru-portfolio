## What is Sheet Pic?

Sheet Pic is a web application that lets you easily extract specific sheets from Excel files containing many worksheets.

## Who is this for?

- You need to split an Excel file with multiple sheets
- You want to extract only sheets containing a specific keyword
- You want to eliminate tedious manual copy & paste
- You need to create a new file while preserving formatting

## Why I built this

In my day job, I frequently dealt with Excel files containing dozens of sheets. Manually copying specific sheets into a new file was time-consuming and error-prone.

So I built a tool to automate the process.

## Technical specs

- Supported formats: .xlsx, .xlsm
- Max file size: 5MB (Web) / Unlimited (Desktop)
