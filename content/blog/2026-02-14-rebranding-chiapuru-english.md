# Rebranding Chiapuru: Going English-First

Today I flipped the switch — chiapuru.com is now an English-first site.

## Why the change?

When I first built this site, everything was in Japanese. That made sense at the time — I'm based in Japan, and my early tools were built for my own workflow.

But things have changed. My desktop app, **SheetToolBox**, solves a problem that isn't unique to Japan. Spreadsheet pain is universal. People everywhere deal with extracting sheets, removing macros, and merging files. And the privacy angle — keeping your files 100% local — matters even more when you're handling sensitive data at work.

If the tool works for anyone, the site should speak to anyone.

## What changed

- **Site language**: All UI text, metadata, and navigation are now in English
- **Brand messaging**: The old tagline was "仕事を効率化するツールを作っています" (roughly: "I make tools to improve work efficiency"). The new one: **"Crafting tools I wish existed"**
- **Product positioning**: Privacy-first, local-only processing, built by an indie maker
- **SEO & OG tags**: All updated to English for better international reach

The blog posts I wrote in Japanese are still here — I'm not deleting anything. Going forward, new posts will be in English.

## What's coming next

**SheetToolBox** is getting ready for its public release. It's a Tauri + Rust desktop app that currently includes three tools:

- **SheetPic** — Extract specific sheets from spreadsheet files
- **MacroRemover** — Strip VBA macros from workbooks
- **SheetMerge** — Combine multiple sheets into one file

All processing happens on your machine. No uploads, no cloud, no data leaves your device.

I'll be sharing more about the launch process — pricing, distribution, code signing, and everything else that goes into shipping a desktop app as a solo developer.

## Building in public

This rebrand is part of a bigger shift. I want to build in public, share the real process, and connect with other indie makers.
